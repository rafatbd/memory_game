# Matching
This project is a matching game done with javascript.

## Summary
Matching games are games that require players to match similar elements. Participants need to find a match for a word, picture, or card. For example, students place 30 word cards; composed of 15 pairs, face down in random order. In this project each person turns over two cards at a time, with the goal of turning over a matching pair, by using their memory.
